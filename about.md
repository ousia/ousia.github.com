My name is Pablo Rodríguez and this is my website.

As you might read in my name, I’m from Spain (Europe, if this helps).

I’m interested in texts. This means reading, writing and using computers to compose texts.

I’m afraid I don’t spend much time updating my website. I don’t have much time avaiable for this task.

Just in case it’s relevant to you, I’m not social on internet (except for coding). I don’t have time for that. And I value my privacy too much to expose myself to a whole planet (of strangers).

The basic idea of this website is to make available resources that may be interesting (and useful) to other people.


By the way, excuse my English, if sometimes is broken (I’m not a native speaker).

If you can read Spanish, you might want to visit <http://www.pablo-rodriguez.tk>.
